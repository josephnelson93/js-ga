This repository documents projects and work I complete as a student outside of [General Assembly's 10 week JavaScript class](https://generalassemb.ly/education/javascript-development). All of the in-class work (including associated homework, exercises, and readings) is in a private repository that is forked from the curriculum.

Hopefully with some JavaScript I can make data science much more approachable, or at least present my results in a more appealing and interactive way.

## Wages Repo
I'm interested in investigating Obama's [new overtime rules](https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/final2016/) change the incentive for employees in salary negotiation. Much like the economics of the earned income tax credit ([graph](http://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F845%2F845d8be7-72e7-41a2-88b9-42f5a9e72576%2FphpJwfZ3l.png)), it changes the utility-maximizing point for employees in the labor market. Unlike the EITC, however, it may encourage employees to request a lower listed salary so that they are still within the guaranteed overtime ceiling.

My current work on this is [here](https://github.com/josephnelson93/js-ga/tree/master/wages).
