## Wages Repo
I'm interested in investigating Obama's [new overtime rules](https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/final2016/) change the incentive for employees in salary negotiation. Much like the economics of the earned income tax credit ([graph](http://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F845%2F845d8be7-72e7-41a2-88b9-42f5a9e72576%2FphpJwfZ3l.png)), it changes the utility-maximizing point for employees in the labor market. Unlike the EITC, however, it may encourage employees to request a lower listed salary so that they are still within the guaranteed overtime ceiling.
